# DataAPI_Project
A project to serve a csv data as an API
## Story Behind the Project

<p?>
While learning about data engineering I was just learning to use API into a data engineering project.
So, while I was learning I noticed that the API I was about to use (Twitter's) was no longer free to use, but I got a csv dataset by kaggle.

    Then a thought hit my mind, why not be make an application which can turn any csv data to host as an API.

    With my existing knowledge of python, fastapi and pandas I starting this project's outlining.
